# Housing Prices Prediction Model
## 1. Defining the Question
### a) Specifying the Question
To develop a model that can predict the sale of prices for the Hass Consulting Company

### b) Defining the Metric for Success
We will create a model that will allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

### c) Understanding the context
Hass Consulting Limited was formed in 1992. It offers investment-grade developments all over the City. The developments they offer have been conceptualized by their development team to be high quality assets using a data-driven approach in planning and design, that gears property for high rental returns and an escalated rate of capital growth.

### d). Recording the Experimental Design
We will use exploratory data analysis, such as Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis, in this study to determine the relationships and differences between different variables. We'll also use Multiple Linear Regression, Quantile Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and Elastic Net Regression to make predictions.
